To ensure your custom Gutenberg blocks match your theme's design, you should provide block-specific styles. These styles will affect how the blocks are displayed both within the editor and on the front end of your website.
Block styles can be defined using CSS. You can include these styles in your theme by enqueuing them, and if necessary, use the wp_enqueue_script function with the 'editor_script' property mentioned in the previous step to load block-specific styles in the editor.
Be sure to follow best practices for creating block styles, including using CSS classes and adhering to WordPress's CSS naming conventions.
