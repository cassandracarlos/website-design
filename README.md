# Build your own WordPress theme

This simple WordPress theme is functional as a blog, but is intentionally left as plain as possible. It is designed as a foundation to be built upon into unique themes. Instructions for editing will be added at a later date.

## Description

I (am creating) this theme to A. learn how WordPress theme building-works and B. build a custom theme for my blog. Once it is presentable, I would like to make it accessible to anyone who wants to make their own WordPress theme from scratch. My goal is to make it as easy to read, easy to edit as possible for a newbie.

There are a few prerequisites to theme-building, such as knowledge in PHP, JavaScript and CSS. You'll need to be familiar with those languages to be able to make a theme from scratch.
