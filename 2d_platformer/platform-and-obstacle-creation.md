* Assets Creation
    * design or create 2D sprites for your platforms and obstacles
    * these could be simple rectangles, squares, or more complex shapes depending on your game's design

* Import Assets
    * import the assets into your game development environment
    * organize assets within the engine's project folder for easy access -- (How?)

* Add Colliders
    * in 2d platformer games, you'll typically use box colliders or similar components to define the collision shapes of your platforms and obstacles
    * colliders determine how objects interact with one another in terms of collisions
    * attach BoxCollider2D components to your platform and obstacle game objects

* Positioning
    * place the platforms and obstacles within your game levels using the level editor in your game engine.
    * ensure that the platforms are positioned in such a way that the player can jump and run on them

* Layering
    * assign sorting layers and order in layer values to your platforms and obstacles.
    * this determines the visual order of objects in the game, ensuring that they appear correctly on the screen

* Platform Variations:
    * you can create different types of platforms, such as moving platforms, breakable platforms, or platforms with specific behaviours, depending on your game's design
    * to achieve this, you'll need to add more complex logic and possibly custom scripts to these objects
