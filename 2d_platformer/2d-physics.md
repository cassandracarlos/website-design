In a 2D platformer game, 2d physics are used to simulate the behaviour of objects in the game world, including the player character and other game elements. Here's how they work:

* Rigidbody2D
    * in most game engines, you'll attach a Rigidbody2D component to game objects that need to be affected by physics
    * this includes the player character and objects like crates or enemies

* Gravity
    * you'll configure the Rigidbody2D component to apply a downward force on objects, making them fall or jump according to the game's gravity settings

* Collision Detection
    * the physics system handles collision detection between objects with colliders
    * when objects with colliders overlap or collide, the physics engine generates collision events

* Forces and Movement
    * use forces like AddForce in Unity or apply_linear_impulse in Godot, to move objects
    * for example, you'll apply a force to the player character to make them jump or move horizontally

* Friction and Drag
    * you can configure parameters like friction and drag to control how objects slide on surfaces or slow down when no external forces are applied

* Kinematic vs. Dynamic Bodies
    * in a 2d platformer, the player character typically uses dynamic Rigidbody2D, while some platforms may use kinematic Rigidbody2D
    * kinematic bodies are typically used for objects that should be controlled programmatically rather than responding to physics

* Jumping:
    * you'll implemenet jumping mechanics by applying an upward force to the player when they press the jump button
    * the force should overcome gravity, allowing the player to jump

* Ground Detection:
    * to determine if the player is grounded (standing on a platform), you'll typically cast a short ray or use a trigger collider from the player character's feet
    * if the ray or trigger hits a platform, the character is considered grounded and can jump
