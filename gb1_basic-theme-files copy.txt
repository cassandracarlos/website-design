Basic Theme Files:

style.css: This is the primary stylesheet for your theme. In the style.css file, you should include essential information about your theme, such as its name, description, author, version, and other metadata. This information helps WordPress recognize your theme. Here's an example of what your style.css might look like:

css
Copy code
/*
 Theme Name: Your Theme Name
 Description: A brief description of your theme.
 Author: Your Name
 Version: 1.0
*/
index.php: The index.php file is the main template file for your theme. This file typically includes the basic structure of your theme, including the header, footer, and the loop that displays posts or other content. You may also create additional template files for specific content types like single posts, pages, and archives.

functions.php: The functions.php file is where you can add custom functions and WordPress hooks to extend the functionality of your theme. You can use it to register support for various features, define custom post types, and enqueue styles and scripts.
